# Introduction

Welcome to my analysis of the üìä data job market, focusing on Data Analyst roles in Singapore! üá∏üá¨ This project was created out of a desire to navigate and understand the job market more effectively. üîç It delves into the top-paying üí∞ and in-demand skills to help find optimal job opportunities for data analysts.

The data, sourced from Luke Barousse's Python course üêç, provides a foundation for my analysis, containing detailed information on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills. Through a series of Python scripts üíª, I explore key questions such as the most demanded skills üìà and the intersection of demand and salary in data analytics. üöÄ

# The Questions

Below are the questions I want to answer in my project:

1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles in Singapore?

2. How are in_demand skills trending for Data Analysts?

3. What are the optimal skills for data analysis to learn? (High Demand and High Paying)

# Tools I used 

For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

    - Python: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to find the data and find critical insights. I also used the following python libraries:

            - Pandas Library: This was used to analyze the data.

            - Matplotlib Library: I Visualized the data.

            - seaborn Library: Helped me create more advanced visuals.

    - Jupyter Notebooks: The tool I used to run my Python scripts which let me easily include my notes and analysis.

    - Visula Studio Code: My go-to for executing my python scripts.

    - Git & GitHub: Essential version control and sharing my Python code and analysis.

# Data Preparation and cleanup

This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

### Import & Clean Up Data

I start by improting necessary libraries and loading the dataset. followed by initial data cleaning task to ensure data.

# The Analysis

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles in Singapore?

To find the most demanded skills for top 3 data roles in Singapore through filtering out those positions by which ones were the most popular and got the 5 top skills for the top 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills showing
which skills I should pay attention to depending on the tole I'm targeting.

### Visualize Data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)

for index, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_count[df_skills_count['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)
    df_plot.plot(kind='barh', x='job_skills', y='skill_count', ax=ax[index], title= job_title)
    ax[index].invert_yaxis()
    ax[index].set_ylabel('')
    ax[index].legend().set_visible(False)

fig.suptitle('Counts of Top Skills in Job Posting', fontsize = 15)
fig.tight_layout(h_pad=1)
plt.show()
```

### Insights

SQL:

- Essential across all roles (55%-56% demand for Analysts and Engineers; 50% for Scientists).
- Core skill for querying and managing databases, crucial for data analysis, ETL processes, and dataset extraction.

Python:

- Highly demanded (47%-68%) with the most use in Data Science.
- A versatile tool for data analysis, automation, machine learning, and big data processing.

Excel:

- Key skill for Data Analysts (35% demand).
- Used for organizing, analyzing, and visualizing data, but less relevant for Engineers and Scientists.


# The Analysis

## 2. How are in_demand skills trending for Data Analysts?

To analyse the top 5 trending skills of Data Analyst in Singapore which were filtered through the month in dataframe.
Using the explode method which converted the job_skills into list that helped to seperate the data, and assigned the data to the index values. Finally we got the top 5 trending skills of Data Analyst role.

### Visualize Data

```python 
df_plot = df_da_sg_perc.iloc[:, :5]

sns.lineplot(data=df_plot, dashes=False, palette='tab10')
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
sns.despine()

plt.title('Trending Top Skills for Data Analysts in the Sg')
plt.ylabel('Likelihood in Job Postings')
plt.xlabel('2023')
plt.legend().remove()

from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter
ax = plt.gca()
ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(PercentFormatter(decimals=0))
```
### Results

### Insights

SQL (51%)

- The most consistently demanded skill across the year.
- Peaks in the middle of the year but shows a gradual decline toward December.
- Essential for querying and managing databases, making it a core skill for Data Analysts.

Python (46%)

- Maintains strong demand throughout the year with minor fluctuations.
- Slight decline in the latter half of the year.
- A versatile tool for data analysis, automation, and visualization.

- Excel (30%) and Tableau (30%)

- Both exhibit similar demand trends, with fluctuations throughout the year.
- Demand decreases slightly in the second half of the year.
- Excel is crucial for organizing and analyzing data, while Tableau is vital for creating interactive visualizations.

R (21%)

- Least demanded skill among the listed ones.
- Demand remains stable with minimal variation.
- Primarily used for statistical analysis and niche modeling tasks.

# The Analysis

## 3. What are the optimal skills for data analysis to learn? (High Demand and High Paying)

Analysing the top skills which are greater than 8% of the skill_percent of data analyst roles in Singapore with the help of pandas, which segregates the job_skills count value and compares it with a total number of job_skills count value so that we get the percentage (doing mathematical operations). Then, we plot the skills on the graph according to their related field using the for loop in the dictionary method. Finally, we get the percentage of top skills greater than 8% for data analyst roles in Singapore.
